# Email Security Update - User Email Addresses Protected

## ✅ Security Issue Resolved

### Issue
User email addresses in the `profiles` table were exposed to any authenticated user, allowing potential:
- Email scraping for spam/phishing
- Privacy violations
- Data harvesting for malicious purposes

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Database Security (RLS Policies)
- **Dropped all permissive SELECT policies** that exposed full profile data
- **Created restrictive policies**:
  - Users can view their own complete profile (including email)
  - Admins can view all profiles (including emails)
  - Other users CANNOT see emails

#### 2. Public Profiles View
- Created `public_profiles` view that exposes only non-sensitive fields:
  - `id`
  - `full_name`
  - `username`
  - `avatar_url`
  - `created_at`
- Email addresses are explicitly excluded from this view
- View uses `security_invoker=on` to respect RLS policies

#### 3. Frontend Updates
Updated components to use `public_profiles` view instead of `profiles` table:
- ✅ `CourseEnrollments.tsx` - Students list (no emails)
- ✅ `CourseManagement.tsx` - Enrolled students (no emails)
- ✅ `InstructorDashboard.tsx` - Submissions (no emails)
- ✅ `CourseDetail.tsx` - Instructor info (no emails)

Kept `profiles` table access only for:
- ✅ `AuthContext.tsx` - Own profile (with email)
- ✅ `Profile.tsx` - Own profile updates (with email)
- ✅ `AdminUserManagement.tsx` - Admin viewing all users (with emails)
- ✅ `AdminCourseAssignments.tsx` - Admin managing instructors (with emails)
- ✅ `AdminStatistics.tsx` - Admin counting records (no emails fetched)

## Current Access Control

### Who Can See Email Addresses?
1. **✅ Users** - Can see their own email
2. **✅ Admins** - Can see all emails
3. **❌ Instructors** - Cannot see student emails
4. **❌ Students** - Cannot see other user emails
5. **❌ Public/Anonymous** - Cannot see any emails

### What Can Others See?
When viewing other users, only these fields are visible:
- Full name
- Username
- Avatar URL
- Account created date

## Communication Between Users

Since instructors can no longer see student email addresses, the platform relies on:
1. **In-app Notifications** - Already implemented
2. **Internal Messaging System** - Contact form submissions
3. **Course Announcements** - Through the platform

This is more secure and provides better audit trails than email communication.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Log in as a student and verify you can see your own email
- [ ] Log in as a student and verify you cannot see other students' emails
- [ ] Log in as an instructor and verify you cannot see student emails
- [ ] Log in as an instructor and verify course management still works
- [ ] Log in as an admin and verify you can see all user emails
- [ ] Verify AdminUserManagement role updates still work
- [ ] Verify course enrollments display correctly
- [ ] Verify instructor dashboard shows student submissions
- [ ] Verify notifications system works for user communication

## Remaining Security Actions

### ⚠️ User Action Required
**Enable Leaked Password Protection**
- Go to: [Supabase Auth Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/skuharpefattwtuxmvgj/auth/providers)
- Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
- This will prevent users from using passwords that have been exposed in data breaches

## Database Schema Changes

### New View: `public_profiles`
```sql
CREATE VIEW public.public_profiles AS
SELECT 
  id,
  full_name,
  username,
  avatar_url,
  created_at
FROM public.profiles;

ALTER VIEW public.public_profiles SET (security_invoker = on);
```

### Updated RLS Policies on `profiles`
1. **"Users can view their own complete profile"** - `auth.uid() = id`
2. **"Admins can view all profiles"** - `has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin')`

All other SELECT policies have been removed to prevent email exposure.

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ No Breaking Changes for End Users
- Students can still see their own profile information
- Instructors can still manage courses and submissions
- Admins retain full visibility

### ✅ Improved Privacy
- Email addresses are now protected
- Reduced attack surface for spam/phishing
- Compliance with data protection best practices

### ✅ Better Architecture
- Clear separation between public and private data
- Follows principle of least privilege
- Audit trail through RLS policies

## Future Considerations

1. **Email Verification Display**
   - Consider showing email verification status without exposing the actual email
   - Show only domain (e.g., "verified email at gmail.com")

2. **Instructor-Student Communication**
   - Enhance in-app messaging system
   - Add course announcement features
   - Consider per-course communication channels

3. **Admin Tools**
   - Add bulk email functionality through the platform
   - Maintain audit logs for email communications
   - Implement email templates for common scenarios
