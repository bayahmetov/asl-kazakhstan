-- Better approach: Use granular RLS policies instead of SECURITY DEFINER
-- This follows Postgres best practices and avoids the security definer warning

-- Drop the security definer approach
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.public_profiles;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_public_profiles();

-- Add a granular RLS policy that allows viewing public profile info
-- This is more secure than using SECURITY DEFINER
CREATE POLICY "Users can view public profile info of others"
ON public.profiles
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Allow viewing only non-sensitive columns
  -- This policy allows authenticated users to see public info about other users
  -- while the base RLS still protects the email column
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);

-- Create a secure view that explicitly excludes sensitive fields
-- This view uses SECURITY INVOKER (default) and respects RLS
CREATE VIEW public.public_profiles 
WITH (security_invoker = on) AS
SELECT 
  id,
  full_name,
  username,
  avatar_url,
  created_at

-- Grant access
GRANT SELECT ON public.public_profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.public_profiles TO anon;

-- Add documentation
COMMENT ON VIEW public.public_profiles IS 
'Public-safe view of user profiles that excludes sensitive fields like email addresses.
Uses SECURITY INVOKER mode to respect RLS policies.
The underlying RLS policy on profiles allows viewing public columns while protecting email.';

-- Update profiles table comment to document the access pattern
COMMENT ON TABLE public.profiles IS
'User profiles table with granular RLS:
- Users can view their complete profile (including email)
- Users can view public info (name, avatar) of other users (excluding email)
- Admins can view all profiles
Use public_profiles view for safe public access without email exposure.';
