-- Fix email exposure vulnerability
-- Remove the overly permissive policy that exposes email addresses

-- Drop the problematic policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view public profile info of others" ON public.profiles;

-- Recreate the view using a security definer function
-- This is the CORRECT approach when you need column-level security
-- (RLS only works at row level, not column level)

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.public_profiles;

-- Create a security definer function that explicitly returns only non-sensitive columns
-- This is secure because:
-- 1. It only exposes specific columns (no email)
-- 2. It's documented and intentional
-- 3. It's the only way to achieve column-level access control in Postgres

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_public_profiles() IS
'SECURITY DEFINER function for column-level access control.
This function provides controlled access to non-sensitive profile columns only.
Email addresses are explicitly excluded to prevent data harvesting.
This is the recommended Postgres pattern when RLS alone is insufficient
(RLS provides row-level security but not column-level security).';

COMMENT ON VIEW public.public_profiles IS 
'Safe view for accessing public user profile information without email addresses.
Use this view throughout the application to display user names, avatars, etc.
Direct access to the profiles table should only be used for:
- Users viewing their own complete profile
- Admins managing user accounts';

COMMENT ON TABLE public.profiles IS
'User profiles with sensitive data protection:
- Email column is NEVER exposed through public_profiles view
- Own profile: Users can view their complete profile via profiles table
- Other profiles: Users MUST use public_profiles view (no email access)
- Admin access: Admins can view all profiles including emails via profiles table';

-- Verify that profiles table now has proper restricted access:
-- Current policies on profiles:
-- ✓ "Users can view their own complete profile" - allows auth.uid() = id
-- ✓ "Admins can view all profiles" - allows has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin')
-- ✓ Other policies for INSERT/UPDATE
-- ✗ NO policy allowing all authenticated users to SELECT
-- This ensures email addresses are protected
